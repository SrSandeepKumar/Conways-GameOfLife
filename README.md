# Conways-GameOfLife
Conway's game of life.

### Rules   

> 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.    
> 2. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.    
> 3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.    
> 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.   

### Note

> * Best result can be seen when given (any number of) Rows * 9 Columns 
> * reason : i am operating on id's and id's wont be unique in my logic after 9th column
